		Hi, I'm Felipe! I'm passionate about making websites, and I like to think that I'm good at it.
		What's more, my rates are quite affordable, owing to the fact I live somewhere with a low cost
		of living (currently, that's Nottingham, UK.) Did I mention I'm also Cambridge educated? I've
		been working part-time at getting a PhD there, which is focused on my other passion: theoretical
		computer science. Anyway, that's all to say that by hiring me, I can guarantee you world-class
		quality, at a world-class budget. You don't have to take my word for it though, have a look
		around the website, and see for yourself. If you like what you find, don't hesitate to contact
		me, I look forward to turning your vision into a reality!
